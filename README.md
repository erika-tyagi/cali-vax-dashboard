#### Measles Vaccination Rates for Every Kindergarten in California

This project builds a dashboard showing MMR vaccinaton coverage data across elementary schools in California. I rely on data from the [California Department of Public Health](https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/school-immunizations-in-kindergarten-by-academic-year). 

The bulk of the work for this project is contained in `src/app.js`, supplemented by `src/stylesheets/main.css` and `index.html`. I process my raw data using `data/process-data.R`. 

The scaffolding for this repository (development server, linters, autoformaters, etc.) is borrowed from Andrew McNutt's [example JavaScript project](https://github.com/mcnuttandrew/capp-30239-workshops/tree/master/example-scaffold).
