      <h1>Measles Vaccination Rates for Every Kindergarten in California</h1>
      <p>In 2000, measles was <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/measles/about/history.html">declared eliminated</a> from the United States – largely due to the development of a highly effective vaccine against measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) and a strong national vaccination program that achieved high coverage among children. In recent years, however, the rise of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vaccine_hesitancy">anti-vaccination movement</a> has left several communities with concerningly low measles vaccination coverage. <a href="https://www.who.int/immunization/sage/meetings/2017/october/2._target_immunity_levels_FUNK.pdf">Experts recommend</a> that at least 92 to 95 percent of a community be vaccinated against measles to protect against outbreaks.
